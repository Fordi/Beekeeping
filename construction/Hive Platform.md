Hive Platform
-------------

Creates a level surface for five hives, away from the ground, protecting them from flooding, ants, and allowing for improved airflow through the hive


## Requirements
* Needs to support five hives, containing up to two hive body supers (50 kg) and two honey supers (30 kg), plus margin of error (1.5) - total support requirement: 240 kg
* Should be minimally expensive (off-the-shelf, inexpensive constructrion materials)
* Should have reasonably high mass (to avoid being blown over)
* Should have an open bottom (to allow mites to fall through)
* Should be rot-resistant
* Should not raise hive significantly off the ground, but should have enough room on the legs to fit a (perhaps removable) greased bell.
    
## Ideas
* 1/2 Schedule 40 PVC tubing should be sufficient for the legs, at $2.50/10ft
* Pressure-treated 2x4

The wooden frame looks like a good idea and design.  My version would add triangular board pairs on the corners and squares in the middle supports, both for the purposes of accepting the PVC legs.  The lower board will have a hole through it; the upper one will have a depression to align the leg.
