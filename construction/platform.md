Hive Platform
-------------

Creates a level surface for five hives, away from the ground, protecting them from flooding, ants, and allowing for improved airflow through the hive


## Requirements
* Needs to support five hives
    * Hive is up to two brood supers (50 kg) and two honey supers (30 kg)
    * The other components are of low mass, comparatively.
    * With a margin of error of 0.5, that's a total support requirement of 240 kg.
* Should be minimally expensive (off-the-shelf, inexpensive construction materials)
* Should have reasonably high mass, to avoid falling over in the wind when empty
* Should have an open bottom (to allow mites to fall through)
* Should be rot-resistant
* Should raise hive off the ground, at least three feet


## Ideas
* 1/2 Schedule 40 PVC tubing should be enough for the legs, at $2.50/10 ft
* Pressure-treated pine two-by-four, available at $2.50 / 8 ft
* [This frame] looks like a good idea and design.  My version would add triangular board pairs on the corners, and squares in the middle supports. both are for the purposes of accepting the PVC legs.  The lower board will have a hole through it; the upper one will have a depression to align the leg.
* The metal crossbars shown in the video may also work.
