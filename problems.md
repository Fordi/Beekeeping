# Threats to colony

* Ants, particularly argentine ants.
* Varroa mites
* Deformed wing virus
* [American foulbrood] (bacterial, larva-targetting, serious infection warrants complete burn of hive and bees)
* [Chalkbrood] (fungal, larvae-targetting)

## Ant prevention measures

* Add belled legs to hive platform
    * That is, legs have a bell on them, the inside or the bell is greased.  The ants are unable to climb past this barrier
    
## Varroa mites: know your enemy

* [Varroa reproductive cycle]
* [Varroa-resistant bees]
