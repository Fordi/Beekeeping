# Hive construction

* [Plans for a 10-frame hive super]

A hive is generally constructed of the following layers, starting bottom to top:

* A hive stand
    * Rot-resistant wood
    * Should match the stacking dimensions of the supers
    * Should have an open bottom, to allow the release of varroa mites
    * Optionally, on legs, to reduce attack by ants.
