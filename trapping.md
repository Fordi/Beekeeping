# Trapping

* [Nasonov pheromone] can be used to attract bees to a swarm trap
    * Synthetic nasonov is made of [citral] and [geraniol] in a 2:1 ratio
    * Citral and geraniol are both present in [lemongrass] oil - aka citronella - though lemongrass is heavier in citral than synthetic preparations.
    * [Growing lemongrass] and [extracting the oil] is not a bad idea; it's a perennial that can tolerate potting and living indoor in the winters.  Extraction is a relatively straightforward cook-and-capture process, similar to making liquid smoke.
