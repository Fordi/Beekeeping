# Trapping

* [Nasonov pheromone] can be used to attract bees to a swarm trap
    * Synthetic nasonov is made of [citral] and [geraniol] in a 2:1 ratio
    * Citral and geraniol are both present in [lemongrass] oil - aka citronella - though lemongrass is heavier in citral than synthetic preparations.
